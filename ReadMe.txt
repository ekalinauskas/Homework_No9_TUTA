TUTA Homework no. 9
Selenium WEB Automation practise and learning.
Testing website: http://automationpractice.com/index.php Note that this website is fake, do not use any real data while creating an account.

Test No. 1 "Create Acc":
	For this test there is no assert because it could be created only one time with unique credentials. As a assertion will be test No. 2. If
	Test No. 2 is succesful it means that user is registered.

Test No. 2 "Login"
	Working properly.

Test No. 3 "Search"
	Working properly.

Test No. 4 "Buy Item"
	Working properly.


After creating all the tests I tried to put everything in POM and classes, but it was really unsuccesful for me. I think that for now I have way more little knowledge to do it without any help. I need to sudy more C# language and Selenium. I am not familiar with c# language. Python is my horse for now but also I am just beginner on it as well.

Have a nice day!
